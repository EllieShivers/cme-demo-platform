  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is a student project in Continuing Medical Education/Continuing Professional Development for healthcare
    providers regarding Transgender and/or Nonbinary patients. The course and this host application were developed by
    Elizabeth Shivers (<a href="mailto:jshivers3@gatech.edu">jshivers3@gatech.edu</a>) originally for Georgia Institute
    of Technology's CS6460 Educational Technology, incorporated into a CS8903 Special Problems course in Fall 2020.
    Please keep in mind that this app is only intended to demonstrate the course material, and is not a fully functional
    web application. This version of the application should only be viewed on a desktop device, as it is not designed to
    be responsive for mobile devices (though a larger tablet should be fine).
  </p>

  <p>
    The course content provided within is, as of Fall 2020, currently undergoing evaluation as part of a CS8903 Special
    Problems course in order to refine the material and identify areas of weakness. For more information on this study
    or to participate, please visit the survey page at

  <h2>Demo Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    To get started, select Unit 1 in the left menu. This will open the unit's menu as well as the first lesson in the
    unit. This course moves linearly through the materials, and includes written text lessons, video lessons, and
    quizzes. Quizzes are not designed to be graded, and are only intended as concept reinforcement.

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Every year medical providers are required to participate in Continuing Medical Education (CME) to maintain their
    licenses. Educational Technology is providing an avenue for delivering CME content effectively and efficiently. At
    the same time, the need for increased medical provider knowledge regarding both medical and cultural aspects of
    care for patients who are Transgender and/or Nonbinary has not been addressed. The goal of this project is to
    develop Transgender and Nonbinary CME content, utilizing Educational Technology to address a rapidly changing
    landscape of care for these patients as well as address key cultural knowledge that is often omitted from purely
    technical areas of education, improving overall provider knowledge and, as a result, quality of care.</p>
