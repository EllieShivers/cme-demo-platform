This may or may not be at a point roughly in the middle of the male-female ends of the spectrum, and a nonbinary person may be more one than the other and still be nonbinary.

This goes hand in hand with the concept that presentation does not define gender identity, just as with gender non-conforming binary people.  The terms are also sometimes used as generic descriptors for binary people as well, or simply a catch all for anyone transitioning in a certain direction regardless of their gender identity.',

While someone who is transmasculine is most commonly assigned female at birth, and likewise the opposite for those who are transfeminine, this is not an absolute.

Nonbinary people may find themselves facing gender dysphoria in the same way that binary transgender people do. A person assigned male at birth whose gender identity is nonbinary and undergoes feminizing HRT to address their dysphoria is still nonbinary, not a transgender woman. The act of medical transition does not automatically dictate a binary status. If such a person identifies as a nonbinary woman, this is independent to the act of medical transition.',
