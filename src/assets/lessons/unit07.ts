The relatively small size of the community and the overlap with other forms of marginalization, most notably poverty, is part of what makes these patients some of the most vulnerable. Nationwide there are only a handful of transgender and/or nonbinary elected representatives, judges, CEOs, and so forth. Many with any degree of influence do what they can, but they can only do so much. The transgender/nonbinary community <em>needs</em> allies. That is to say, they require the open support of cisgender people, regardless of whether they are or are not otherwise part of the LGBTQ+ community.",
              "Due to stereotypes and misinformation, healthcare providers are in a unique position to provide a large degree of influence on those around them in building understanding and support of transgender/nonbinary people. Many people look towards doctors and others to take their cues on the topic as they are perceived as experts on the human body or mind. In addition to providing improved quality of patient care, this is why providing context about transgender and/or nonbinary patients from a broad, social perspective was important. The hope is that healthcare providers walk away from this course not only able to support their patients, but encourage understanding and compassion from those around them."

That is to say, an environment that is explicitly affirming. Many transgender and/or nonbinary people learn the hard way how to spot the difference between an environment that is affirming and seeing through those which are not, or which only pretend to be.",

This doesn't need to be a grand gesture (in fact any overly grand gesture may be counter productive) and can be as simple as providing pamphlets in your waiting room about LGBTQ+ and transgender/nonbinary specific topics.

You should also be aware of any even passingly transphobic print media, including some news journals. While it is impossible to vet everything, pay attention to the tone of cover stories. There have been a handful of major publications which have printed transphobic articles in the past few years, and it is never a good feeling for a transgender/nonbinary person to encounter them."

These should be avoided, as while they are generally considered good natured and fun, there is always a chance they may make someone feel as their identity is being trivialized.",

Many may assume that if they make it clear they hold certain political beliefs that this may translate into showing transgender and/or nonbinary patients they are trans and nonbinary inclusive. This is absolutely not enough. While the stereotypical views of politics in the United States is that the American left is inherently more inclusive than the American right, a transgender and/or nonbinary person is no more likely to automatically feel safe in a left leaning environment than are a right leaning one. In unit 4, we discussed the existence of a group known as \"Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists\", who are ostensibly very left leaning, yet they are one of the most openly hostile groups to transgender interests. Even prominent people such former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saw controversy in 2019 surrounding views she expressed on transgender issues. Some political messaging may still qualify as subtle welcome signs, such as that surrounding some major legal or activist groups known to support transgender and/or nonbinary rights, though even then it is not a substitute for more trans and nonbinary specific overtures."

As many people may be in situations where they cannot present as their gender identity, this is often seen as an affirmining approach to allowing people to state who they are preemptively, foregoing any accidental misgendering in what is meant to be a safe environment.",
              "While overwhelmingly positive in the majority of cases, there is still a potential pitfall of which people should be aware. Unfortunately, for those who are questioning or just coming to grips with who they are, pronoun circles can lead to the revelation of details in the moment that they later regret others knowing, most prominantly their deadname. It is extremely important that you make participation voluntary, and let people know, particularly new participants, that they should be careful about what they choose to share.
