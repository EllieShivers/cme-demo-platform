You may also see variations of the abbreviated acronym such as LGBTQIA(+), in which letters explicitly are intended to not have a singular meaning as repeated letters are collapsed together to represent as many sexualities or identities as possible while still being accessible to write. For some, the ‘Q’, meaning Queer, also performs this functionality as a catch all for the remainder of the acronym, though this can be problematic given that someone may identify as, say, Asexual or Intersex while not identifying as Queer, and it certainly is not applicable to Ally when it is included."

This is a very important topic that could not possibly be done justice in the space we have available here, but it largely comes down to that divergence from the norm on both sexuality and gender has been met with the same forms of oppression, plus that prior to modern understandings of gender identity the line was far more blurred in any case. The acronym was born as representative of the Pride movement, which in turn is largely credited to the 1969 Stonewall riots during which transgender people played a major role. Simply put, the LGBTQ+ community shares common culture and a common battle against oppression. Homophobic and transphobic rhetoric are overwhelmingly repetitive, and legal oppression aimed at non-hetero sexualities does not often make exceptions based on gender identity.",

For instance, a straight transgender woman (male attracted) may have, prior to coming out as transgender, publicly identified as a gay man for their life until that point.

However, for some there may not be an alignment between sexual and romantic attraction and the distinction is important to them.

This view of sexuality is unequivocally transphobic.",
        "A transgender person’s genitals are part of their body as a woman, man, or nonbinary person. A transgender woman’s penis is a woman’s penis. A transgender man’s vagina is a man’s vagina. A nonbinary person’s genitals are neither male nor female, both, or whatever is applicable to their identity.",
        "Many people reading this may chafe at this assertion, but it is actually rooted in nature. Broadly speaking, genitals in any configuration are equivalent structures, and many species have diverging genital structures from humans in any case. Associating a specific genital configuration with a specific sex or gender is an aspect of cis-normativity. Ascribing an explicitly male or female sex determination to a transgender person’s genitals is denial of their identity as man, woman, or nonbinary. To put this into context, would you consider a cisgender woman who receives a double mastectomy to then have a “man’s chest”?",
        "Now, to be exceedingly clear, this is absolutely not a judgment on any individual basing part of their attraction on genitals, nor stating that any such attraction is inherently transphobic. This can be accounted for with the phase “genital preference”. Here we enter another extremely contentious debate even within the transgender and nonbinary community, which we will not delve into in full detail as part of this course but will strive to provide a high-level overview regarding.",
        "Genital preference can to a degree be considered the same as any other preference, in that it may be rooted in bigotry or it may not. If a straight cis man were to refuse to date a transgender woman because they believe it to be gay to interact with someone with a penis, that is certainly transphobic. If in the same scenario the cis man simply isn’t attracted to penises and in impacts their attraction to someone they legitimately see as a woman, then that is not typically considered transphobic, though some might assert there is still transphobia at play in informing learned preference through cis-hetero-normative cultural standards."
