In David Haig’s “The Inexorable Rise of Gender and the Decline of Sex: Social Change in Academic Titles, 1945–2001”, he asserts that much of this hinges on the use of the term gender in the context of gender roles by John Money through the last half of the 20th century, and its subsequent adoption by feminism. Prior to that, this was not the typical usage.',

Are they a third sex, or fourth sex, or fifth sex, and so forth? This is not something that many people would argue. Someone may then say that these are simply mutations or disorders, and that a person with atypical chromosomes are still male or female. That may very well be, but that very assertion itself disqualifies chromosomes as an absolutely determinant of sex.',
        'In the majority of cases, sex is recorded somewhat arbitrarily by observation of visible primary sex characteristics at birth. Yet, intersex people make up, by some estimates, 1.7% of births, many cases which cannot be identified until puberty or even later in life, and then many times who prove to meet far more criteria for the opposite sex than that they were observed as being at birth. In other words, it is a fairly regular occurrence that what we observe at birth is not always accurate. And of course, most of these observable characteristics are the very ones many transgender people actively seek to change.',

Or, is the distinction of sex and gender a meaningless one to begin with?',

For example, the term transsexual clearly indicated that it was the view for years that people transitioning were changing their sex, not just gender. This is likewise shown by other historical terms such as Sex Reassignment Surgery. The shift to the phrase transgender was not eschewing this, but rather it was an attempt to shift from what was deemed as demeaning terminology for several reasons, partially due to avoiding sex essentialism as per later feminist dialogue—that is, reducing people to their reproductive organs as how they are defined in society.'

It is well known that historically, non-heterosexual orientations have been treated as a mental health disorder to be cured, and the same holds true for being transgender. The use of the term transsexual can be viewed as an extension of that history. Medical practitioners were traditionally placed in a role to gatekeep who was or who was not transgender, hinging someone’s very identity on a clinical diagnosis—a diagnosis that was often very conditional based on the practitioner’s views and held stereotypes, with views often entirely informed by bigotry and misogyny. By moving away from the term transsexual, the transgender community has sought to reclaim identities as their own.

For instance, people hostile to transgender rights will often use sex essentialist phrasing, be it attempting to draw distinct lines between male and female as sexes thus excluding transgender people, or by adding qualifiers such as the terms “biological” or “natal”, that inherently separate binary transgender people from those assigned that sex at birth and erasing nonbinary people entirely.

Externally, transgender/nonbinary identities are debated publicly, civil rights are threatened legally, and transgender/nonbinary people are slurred and met with open bigotry almost every day of their lives. Internally, they often face these sorts of debates as well, as they struggle to find themselves while feeling as though they are drowning in a cis-normative society that doesn’t understand. Every transgender and/or nonbinary person is a philosopher to some degree, who has been forced to consider the topic of what it means to be male or female, or neither, whether they want to or not. What was summarized here in a dozen paragraphs may even be part of an internal dialogue lasting decades, and that is just the tip of the iceberg.',

In other words, if you view yourself as transgender, you are transgender.',

Or rather, for a cisgender person, what does it feel like to be a man or a woman? There is no easy answer, if a universal answer is possible at all, and this also applies to transgender people. How does a transgender woman recognize they are internally a woman? What does the feeling of being a woman even mean? While there are countless individual narratives, this often does not come down to an innate sense of what one is, though it certainly can, but rather recognizing that there is something incongruent about one’s current existence in some manner in regards to gender.',

Sometimes, it is as simple as strongly associating with fictional characters not of the gender they were assigned at birth, or using video and roleplaying games as outlets, creating and inhabiting characters more aligned with their gender identity. Often, the nature of what the person is engaging in may not even be recognized for what it truly is until later.',

To be extremely clear, this is not an argument against transition, but rather an argument for tempering expectations and addressing any other underlying concerns to ensure that an individual can approach their transition in a strong state of mental health from which they can benefit fully.

        'One of the most contentious philosophical areas of transition is what is called “passing”. “Passing” is being perceived as one’s gender identity, without being seen as transgender. While this course will not go into the full debate around this term, suffice to say that it is often held that a drive to being able to “pass” as cisgender is ultimately harmful to the individual and community, as it reinforces cis-normative societal standards and can serve to isolate individuals. While not identical, this can be thought of as similar to the more commonly known debate around women feeling forced to meet certain externally imposed standards of femininity, such as with western beauty or behavioral standards.',
        '“Passing” may be more complicated however, in that the external validation or conformance to cis-normative standards can be a byproduct of a valid, internally oriented perception of oneself. This can be seen with many who wish to be perceived as their gender identity completely for their own sake, but do not wish to throw away perception of being transgender by doing so. Regardless of whether one passes, visibility may be maintained for the sake of the community.'

        'For transgender people, safety is often a major concern as well. Non-passing transgender people face more abuse in society, and even absent any desire for internal or external relief for dysphoria or purposeful conformation to cis-normativity, a transgender person may seek to pass to avoid harm while going about their lives. This plays directly into a related concept, “stealth”.'

The concept has strong connections with the history of violence against transgender people and feeling the need to blend completely into the majority cis society to avoid harm. Someone may be stealth in some situations, but not in others.'

        'This also plays into how you communicate with transgender patients. A common cliché is that cisgender individuals will make comments about how “they never would have guessed” or backhanded statements such as “you look like a real man/woman”. Unless you are explicitly engaged in a facet of treatment involving external perception, such as with mental health providers exploring the topic at the behest of a patient or a surgeon seeking to identify patient goals for a procedure, you should avoid this area of discussion entirely—though even in those cases, care should be taken. What may seem like a harmless compliment, may in fact be far more than that for your patient.'
